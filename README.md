Module 5 Final Project: Bootstrap Website (Portfolio) re-creation with basic Javascript functions 

I went with a portfolio style webpage but instead of basing it around me as a software engineer I based it around me as a content creator (my dream job). I would like to turn this in as a work in progress without the assets because they are taking too long to create and implement. I went with a portfolio organized by cards and carousels/ The cards hold images & descriptions of the various content in the card. The carousels hold images and are set to autoplay. 

Design notes:
The Home page has pulsating text, my original intention was to have audio autoplaying and construct a javascript function that syncs to the audio down-beats. Thats out of my scope at the moment but i want to figure it out so i left the animation behind
 
JavaScript notes;
The original Mod 5 prompt asked for basic java functions and descriptions without it having to be fully functions and connected to the HTML, im assuming this means the function has to be correct but doesnâ€™t have to directly attach to and run on the website, so the form isn't functional.
